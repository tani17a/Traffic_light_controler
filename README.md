# Traffic_light_controler
Changes the traffic lights according to the traffic

Overview
This project implements a traffic light controller using Verilog HDL. The controller manages the traffic lights at an intersection, ensuring smooth and safe traffic flow. The system operates in a cyclic manner, transitioning between different traffic light states for each direction.

Features
1. Control of traffic lights for all four directions.
2. Configurable timing for each state (Green, Yellow, Red)
3. Modular design for easy understanding and modification.
